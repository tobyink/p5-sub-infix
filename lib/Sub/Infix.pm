=head1 NAME

Sub::Infix - create a fake infix operator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Sub::Infix;
   
   # Operator needs to be defined (or imported) at compile time.
   BEGIN { *plus = infix { $_[0] + $_[1] } };
   
   my $five = 2 |plus| 3;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sub::Infix creates fake infix operators using overloading. It doesn't
use source filters, or L<Devel::Declare>, or any of that magic. (Though
Devel::Declare isn't magic enough to define infix operators anyway; I
know; I've tried.) It's pure Perl, has no non-core dependencies, and
runs on Perl 5.6.

The price you pay for its simplicity is that you cannot define an
operator that can be used like this:

   my $five = 2 plus 3;

Instead, the operator needs to be wrapped with real Perl operators in
one of three ways:

   my $five = 2 /plus/ 3;
   my $five = 2 <<plus>> 3;
   my $five = 2 |plus| 3;

The advantage of this is that it gives you three different levels of
operator precedence (decreasing order in the example above).

You can also call the function a slightly less weird way:

   my $five = plus->(2, 3);

=head2 How does it work?

C<< 2 |plus| 3 >> is parsed by perl as: C<< 2 | ( &plus() | 3 ) >>.

C<< &plus() >> returns an object that overloads the C<< | >> operator;
let's call that C<< $obj >>.

The overloaded C<< $obj | 3 >> operation stashes C<< 3 >> inside
C<< $obj >> noting that the number is the right operand, and returns
C<< $obj >>.

Then C<< 2 | $obj >> is evaluated, stashing C<< 2 >> inside C<< $obj >>
as the left operand. At this point, the object notices that it has both
operands, and calls the coderef from the definition of the operator,
passing it both operands.
